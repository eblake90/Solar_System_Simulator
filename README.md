# Solar_System_Simulator
Creating an animation of the gravitational interactions of celestial bodies within our solar system. 

This is a Python animation developed during my physic bachelor studies, and its purpose was to visualize the gravitational interactions among five major celestial bodies: the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The objective was to understand the dynamics of planetary motion within the inner solar system, using the Sun as the central reference point. Different initial conditions and parameters were manually adjusted to observe their influence on planetary orbits. Key findings include:

The Sun, being the most massive entity in the system, remained stationary, serving as the gravitational anchor for the other bodies.
Planets closer to the Sun, like Mercury and Venus, exhibited faster orbital velocities compared to those farther away, such as Mars.
While individual planets primarily followed elliptical orbits due to their own velocities and the gravitational pull of the Sun, their interactions with one another introduced perturbations in their paths.
Minor adjustments in initial velocities or positions could lead to noticeable variations in orbital paths, emphasizing the sensitivity and complexity of multi-body gravitational systems.
